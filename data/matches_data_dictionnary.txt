# # Problem 3
#
# The two datasets `wta_matches.csv` and `wta_players.csv` in data folder contain information about tennis match results.
#
# You can find additional information if needed in the dictionnary file or here : https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta
#
# Please answer the following question by using `wta_matches.csv` and `wta_players.csv` files:
#
# - How many matches were played by surface (Hard/Clay/Grass ...)
# - Which country won the highest number of matches
# - Which player(s) disputed the highest number of games
#     - Be careful, in tennis, one match consists of several games
#     - For example, if the score of a match is 6-1 6-3, both players disputed 16 (6+1+6+3) games during that match
#     - Sometimes score can include a number > 10 (ex: 6-1 3-6 10-8 and both players played 34 games)
#     - Sometimes, you will find number between parenthesis in the score column, for example 6-1 7-6 (2). Numbers between parenthesis can be ignored. In the example, both players disputed 20 games.
#     - Sometimes, you will find a score that ends up with "RET". It means that one of the player abandoned. For example, if the score is 6-1 2-0 RET, both players disputed 9 games.
